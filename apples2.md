# Pet Obesity Survey App
# APPLES Reflection 2

Our impression of the purpose of our project has not changed, and we are equally excited about their mission. Our product is helping their mission by facilitating quick and effective data collection. 

The features that have been the most important to our client are the camera functionality and the overall time to complete the survey. The camera photo interface will allow us to link photos of the pets to the survey submitted about its weight. This will create a dataset to allow training of artificial intelligence to detect and interpret the weights of pets from photographs. This addresses the clientâ€™s intended mission by extending their capabilities and the capabilities of other researchers and veternarians to understand and promote pet health at all levels.
