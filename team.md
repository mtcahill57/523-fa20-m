**Team Rules**
```
1. Communication
More is better, so ask for help and advice when needed.
Use email for communication outside of the developer team unless urgent.
Clearly acknowledge the expectations of an assignment and follow up as needed.
Always message when merging or pushing change to avoid integration errors or oversight.
```
```
2. Meetings
Meeting attendance is expected but not required.
Communicate any forseen absence as soon as possible.
```
```
3. Code style
Clean looking code with emphasis on relevant naming and spacing.
Comment with the intention of helping others during code review.
```
```
4. Git style
Name your commits/branches relevantly.
Separate branches for features.
Prioritize merging to master upon completion to fix integration errors instead of focusing development in one branch.
```
