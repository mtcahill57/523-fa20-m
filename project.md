# Pet Obesity Survey App

```
Short Project Description
```


**Need for Software:**

Our software will augment the work life of veterinarians. Data collection has traditionally been hand written, and the manual entry of this data onto a computer is timely and tedious. By automating the process of data collection, our application will increase the time effectiveness of veterinarians and their assistants. Additionally, our application will allow pet owners to take photos of their pets, which will clear instances of confusion over data entry between veterinarians and pet owners. 

**Target Platform:**

We will be making an android mobile application, specifically targeting a tablet implementation. Tablets have large screens and are mobile, so they will be easy to see and work with while on the move. 

**Target Users:**

Our application will be used by both veterinarians and pet owners. 

**Project Importance:**

Our client Dr. Ernie Ward has made it his mission to fight against pet obesity. He founded the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention in 2005 to do just that. He has been quoted in saying, “Obesity is the number one health threat pets face, and the most important pet health decision owners make each day is what and how much they feed.” Our software will bring pet owners and veterinarians closer together so that the proper information can be shared to keep pets healthy and thriving. 

**Project Goals:**

Our project goals are two part: to make veterinarians’ lives easier, and to construct a bridge of communication between vets and pet owners. On the veterinarian side, we will make it quick and easy to record information and automate the process of entering the data to online spreadsheets. For the pet owners, it will be possible to send their pet’s information remotely, and will include a camera feature so that the vets will be able to confirm the data received.
